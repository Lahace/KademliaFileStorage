# Kademlia File Storage

Kademlia File Storage is a project created for the Distributed Systems course in Computer Science engineering at University of Padua.
It uses p2p system *Kademlia* to distribute file to other peers for storage purpose.
**Project is still on the works**

###### How to use it
As you can see on the `Main.java` you can simply join a network by creating an instance of the `Kademlia` as follows:
```
Kademlia myNode = new Kademlia();
```

You can then start using Kademlia 4 basic RPCs (*FIND_NODE*, *PING*, *FIND_VALUE* and *STORE*) to interact with the p2p network and store files.

That's it!
