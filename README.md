# Kademlia File Storage

Kademlia File Storage is a project created for the Distributed Systems course in Computer Science engineering at University of Padua.
It uses *Kademlia* DHT to distribute file to other peers for storage purpose.
Our goal is to achieve the most permanent file storage solution on a p2p network.
*We will not maintain this project once it's completed from the course point of view*.

##### How does it work?
When instantiating a node, a FIND_NODE RPC is performed on a list of a handful nodes (which is serialized in the `nodes` file) to know at most K nodes which are the closest to our node.
This file is serialized by the `writeFixedNodes` method in `Kademlia.java`, if you need to change those nodes for some implementation/change/whatever purposes, please check that.
From then, all other RPCs can be called to interact with the network.
While a node is instantiated, it will receive files from other peers which are performing a *STORE* RPC on the network. These files are frequently refreshed to quickly react to changes occuring in the network, ensuring file persistance for the longest time possible.

##### How to use it
As you can see in `Main.java` you can simply join a network by creating an instance of the `Kademlia` as follows:
```
Kademlia myNode = new Kademlia();
```

You can then start using Kademlia 4 basic RPCs (*FIND_NODE*, *PING*, *FIND_VALUE* and *STORE*) and an extra RPC (*DELETE*), added by us, to interact with the p2p network and store files.

That's it!
